LEDGER
=======

This program is a simple accounting ledger.

It works properly in GnuCobol 2.0, but it has not been tested in other
COBOL implementations yet.

I wrote this program in memory of my mother, Roberta Young, and the
many hours she spent in front of a green screen terminal entering
COBOL programs when I was a kid.

It is licensed under the MIT license.
